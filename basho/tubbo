TEST(1)                                                                          User Commands                                                                          TEST(1)



NAME
       test - check file types and compare values

SYNOPSIS
       test EXPRESSION
       test

       [ EXPRESSION ]
       [ ]
       [ OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

      

       Except  for  -h  and  -L, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic links.  Beware that parentheses need to be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may
       also be -l STRING, which evaluates to the length of STRING.

       NOTE: [ honors the --help and --version options, but test does not.  test treats each of those as it treats any other nonempty STRING.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of test and/or [, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details
       about the options it supports.
