RMV command

Command syntax:

rmv [file or folder]
  - This created the Trash2 folder, if it doesn't already exist, 
    and then puts the named file or folder into Trash2.  If you 
    feel the need to double-check your action, just look in the 
    /home/your_profile/Trash2 folder
    ls $HOME/Trash2

rmv is a small bash command meant to address a concern among new users that in Linux they can lose files accidentally by using the rm command at the wrong time.

rmv is an alternate to the rm command that removes the file to a special folder in the user's profile called "Trash2."

This script was started at a Linux Freedom Fest hosted on 2/19/2011 by Ale.org and sourcefreedom.com at the Atlanta campus of ITT Technical Institute.  The collaborators were the students of ITT and community members in attendance.  

The name of the command came from Aaron Ruscetta and the initial coding was typed by Wolf Halton.  Contact, wolf@sourcefreedom.com

To use this command, it must be somewhere in all users' PATH, so place it in /usr/local/bin:

# cp rmv /usr/local/bin
